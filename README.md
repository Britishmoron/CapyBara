# CapyBara
This is the official CapyBara repository. Here, we will have all of the games in the drive, AND a possible way to get Crostini (Linux) on your Chromebook.
Note that this is a test, and may not work, or will just absolutly destroy your computer trying to use the Linux test... BUT!! The games cannot destroy it, surpisingly.
One other thing... this has a Github.io page, so it can accessed at home. At home, however, the chatroom will NOT work. Sorry. Working on fixing this.
